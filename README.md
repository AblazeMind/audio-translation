# Audio Translation

## Description
This repository contains the code and resources for an audio translation project. The goal of this project is to develop a system that can automatically translate spoken language from one language to another.

## Features

- Language translation: The system employs machine translation algorithms to translate the recognized text from one language to another.
- Text-to-speech synthesis: The translated text is then converted back into speech using text-to-speech synthesis techniques.
